1. Introduction
The VGA Cookbook is a web-based recipe management system developed by B.Sc. Computer Science students of Vysya College.
It helps users explore different food recipes categorized into North Indian, South Indian, Street Food, Desserts, Vegetarian, Non-Vegetarian, and Popular dishes.

2. Objectives
●	- Provide an easy-to-use online cookbook for students and food enthusiasts.
●	- Showcase web development skills using modern frontend tools.
●	- Allow searching and filtering of recipes.
●	- Create a responsive web application that works on desktop and mobile.
●	- Integrate academic learning with a real-world project.

3. Tools & Technologies Used
●	- HTML5 – Page structure and content
●	- Tailwind CSS – Styling and responsiveness
●	- Google Fonts – Custom fonts (Bangers, Inter)
●	- JavaScript (Vanilla) – Dynamic rendering, filtering, search, and interactivity

4. System Requirements
Hardware:
●	- Minimum: Dual Core Processor, 2 GB RAM, 500 MB Storage
●	- Recommended: i3 Processor or above, 4 GB RAM
Software:
●	- OS: Windows / Linux / macOS
●	- Browser: Chrome, Edge, Firefox (latest)
●	- Editor: VS Code / Sublime / Notepad++

5. System Design
Architecture: Client-side web application with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.
Data stored as JavaScript objects.
Workflow:
●	1. Splash screen loads on startup.
●	2. Main page displays categories and recipes.
●	3. Search bar filters recipes dynamically.
●	4. Category buttons refine recipes.
●	5. “View” button opens details page.
●	6. Back button returns to main list.

6. Implementation
Features:
●	- Splash Screen Animation
●	- Dynamic Recipe Cards
●	- Category Filtering
●	- Search Functionality
●	- Recipe Detail Page
●	- Responsive Design
Code Structure:
●	- index.html → Structure and layout
●	- script.js → Logic for rendering, search, filter
●	- Tailwind CSS → Styling

7. Screenshots
Suggested screenshots to include in the report:
●	1. Splash Screen
●	2. Homepage with Categories
●	3. Recipe Details Page
●	4. Search Results

8. Advantages
●	- Simple, lightweight, and fast
●	- User-friendly interface
●	- No backend required
●	- Responsive design

9. Limitations
●	- Data stored locally in JS (no database)
●	- No user login/authentication
●	- Limited recipes (expandable)

10. Future Enhancements
●	- Database integration (MySQL/Firebase)
●	- Add recipe images
●	- User login to add recipes
●	- AI-based recipe suggestions
●	- Export/share recipes

11. Conclusion
The VGA Cookbook Project demonstrates knowledge of HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.
It successfully provides an interactive recipe platform.
Future scope includes database integration and personalization.
